<h1> AUSTRALIA</h1>

<p ><i> Australia is a continent and it is also a country of its own. Australia is located between the South Pacific and Indian Oceans. Australia is often called, "the land down under," because it lies entirely within the southern hemisphere. In Latin, Australia means "southern." The official name of the country is "the Commonwealth of Australia." 
             Australia is surrounded by water like an island, but geographers classify it as a continent rather than an island because of its great size. Australia covers about 5% of earth's land area. Most of Australia is low and flat, the highest and most mountainous land lies along the east coast. Nearly all the land west of this region consists of level plains and plateaus. 
             At one time, all the continents were part of one huge land mass. Australia became separated from this landmass about 200 million years ago. As a result, its animals developed differently from those on other continents. Australia's most famous native animals include kangaroos, koalas, wallabies, wombats, and other marsupials.

<p ><i>Australia is a major tourist attraction for people travelling from South-East Asia and from Europe, with numerous airlines serving various sectors of passenger’s journeys. Many flights from the Asian region are connecting flights for tourists and serve as stopover countries. Major airports in this region include Singapore Changi, Bangkok and Kuala Lumpur international airports.

South-East Asia is defined by the Britannica Encyclopodia as “taken to include

Burma, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia, Brunei and the Philippines.” This sector of the world contributed 38.3% of total international passenger seats available to Australia in 2009 and 37.6% in 2008. This is a very slight increase and suggests that growth is remaining steady in this region. In a comparison of the years from 2007 through to 2009, the South-East region approximately contributed 38% per annum, with no marked decline.

During 2009, a total of 44 416 scheduled flight movements occurred between South-East Asia and Australia. This accounted for 9.5 million passengers, with 12.7 million total seats available. Inbound air traffic accounted for 22 241 of these scheduled flights and 6.3 million seats available. (Bureau of Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Economics [BITRE], 2010).</i></p>
