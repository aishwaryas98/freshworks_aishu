<h1> NEW ZEALAND</h1>
<p ><i> New Zealand is a land of magnificent and unordinary beauty. This is a wonderful place to learn English, enjoy nature and go mountain-skiing. It is no secret that “The Lord of The Rings” was shot in New Zealand – the nature of New Zealand so closely resembles the magical country! If you are keen on active tourism, you can find all the necessary facilities for hiking, mountain-skiing, rafting and many other kinds of sports here. The country’s distinguishing characteristic is the beauty of its nature. Make your dreams come true! Swim together with dolphins, admire whales, and go fishing! New Zealand is an island country but the sizes of the islands are not large, so it is quite easy and pleasant to travel about/around (not really sure of ‘about/around) regardless of what means of transport you use – a car, a bus, or even a bicycle.

New Zealand culture is quite unordinary. New Zealanders represent a mix of Europeans and the Maoris. They are very friendly and hospitable. A foreigner will be surprised by being greeted on the street by complete strangers. The atmosphere of relaxation and peacefulness prevails everywhere in New Zealand. The murder rate is extremely low compared to any other country of the world and the bribery rate among governmental workers is the lowest in the world (supposedly, there is no such thing as bribes in New Zealand at all). By the way, governmental ministers do not have body guards or escorts. Naturally, making an appointment with one of them is quite easy. Sometimes you can even meet a minister while standing in line in a supermarket. Another practical thing you should know about when you are in New Zealand – you should not give tips in hotels, restaurants etc. because tips are uncommon here.
